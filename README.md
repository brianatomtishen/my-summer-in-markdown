## INTRODUCTION 
- Hi my name is Briana Tomtishen
- I am a senior this year
- I have a twin brother named Gianluca
- I have been on the varsity soccer team for 4 years

## SUMMER ACTIVITIES 
Over the summer I went to many different places such as San Diego, Las Vegas, Balboa Island, and Universal Studios. In San Diego I visited SDSU and UCSD for college tours with my parents and best friend. Right by our hotel was a little town called Little Italy where we ate most days. When I went to Universal Studios, I brought my boyfriend and my cousin from Michigan. I got to go on the ride in Super Nintendo World for the first time and got to step off the tram and see some Universal props up close.

## GOALS FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR
As a senior my main goal for this year is to not let senioritis affect my grades and still be good about getting work done and submitting on time. To make sure this goal is achievable, I have set up a new system at home to make sure I get all of my work done and in on time. The system insures that I set up time every day that is meant for me to complete homework and assignments.

## FAVORITE SUMMER MEMORIES WITH FRIENDS
My favorite summer memory with my friends was going mini golfing in Sherman Oaks with Jackie and Ana. We went to Castle Park and were avle to also use the battinbg cages and the arcade. We did not keep score so it was fun to just mess aaround with them. After we were done mini golfing, we went to hit in the cages. I had not hit in a minute so I was worried I would not do well but I had fun. Lastly, we got food and drinks inside the arcade and shared nachos.

## FUTURE ASPIRATIONS
Over the summer a main topic of conversation was college for not only me but many others in my grade. I have been thinking a lot about what colleges I want to apply to, what states I would be comfortable in, and what is reasonable for me. But the main worry for me has been what field I want to go int and what major I will be putting on my college applications. As a kid I always loved the idea of architecture and interior designing, but as college approaches that ideaa becomes less and less exciting. Over the past year the major that has peaked my interest is finance. For me this seems not only like a stable choice but something that I could do very well in. In high school Mr. Cooper has made my love for math grow which is the main reason I am going with a math major. I believe finance will also provide me with many options when the time comes to join the work force and provide me with a hopefully well off future.
